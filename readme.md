## About K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a simple, yet powerful machine learning technique used for classification and regression. In this project, KNN is utilized to recommend recipes based on the similarity of user preferences. By analyzing the features of various recipes and comparing them to the user's input, the algorithm identifies the most similar recipes to suggest.
